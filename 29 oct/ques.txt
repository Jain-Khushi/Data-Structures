Write a program to implement Binary Search Tree which supports the following operations:
(i) Insert an element x
(ii) Delete an element x (Give option of merging and copying)
(iii) Search for an element x in the BST and change its value to y and then place the node with value y at its appropriate position in the BST
(iv) Display the elements of the BST in preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal (use recursive versions)
